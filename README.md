# JavaFX-Calculator
A simple app that uses JavaFX and various OOP principles to create a vibrant UI to interact with a calculator.

Utilizes OOP principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, as well as the MVC Paradigm alongside complex algorithms such as Shunting Yard, which converts the calculator's screen from infix notation to a readable output. Further, ADTs such as stacks are utilized for optimal lookups and operations in Shunting Yard.

Coded entirely in Java, utilizing the JavaFX UI library to display the calculator application in a separate window for easier access and use.


This project was primarily done over the 2025 summer so that I could practice the use of the JavaFX library, which I had brief exposure to during COMP 1406 at Carleton University. I also had a sense of personal
investment in the project, since I wanted to learn how a regular physical calculator is able to handle complex calculations and what type of code workflow is used to switch between operations and hold a history of previous responses.
